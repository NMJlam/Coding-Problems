SCAFFOLD 

1) Explain the question back to the interviewer 
2) Ask for clarification: 
    - Input validation 
    - Edge cases 
    - Assumptions 
3) Build Test Cases: 
    - Typical output 
    - Invalid output 
    - Edge Cases 
4) Pseudo code the approach
    - Explain the time complexity of each section 
5) Code the solution 
    - Validate the code as are you are moving along 

IMPORTANT 

- While LeetCode is asking you for the most efficient solution 
- The coding interview is actually asking for you to show your problem solving approach 
==> Practice for the coding interview not LeetCode
